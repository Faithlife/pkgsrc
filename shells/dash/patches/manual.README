The "manual-*" patch files are used to maintain the pkgsrc version of
dash.  files/ should contain an unmodified extract of the dash release
tarball, then these patches are applied on top, with both the modified
file and its patch committed to pkgsrc.

This ensures all our changes are correctly documented and makes upgrades
to newer releases easier.
